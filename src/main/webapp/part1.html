            <h2>Understanding Basic Network Terms</h2>
            <p class="command">What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?</p>
            <p class="answer code">5.179.80.204</p>
            <p class="answer code">http://www.whatsmyip.org/</p>
            <p class="command">What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and
                who/what gave you that address?</p>
            <p class="answer code">$ ipconfig > IPv4 Address</p>
            <p class="answer">The address was given to me by the DHCP on the schools network</p>
            <p class="command">What’s special about these address ranges?</p>
            <p class="answer">These addresses are used for private addresses.</p>
            <p class="command">What’s special about this ip-address: <span class="code">127.0.0.1</span>?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span class="code">127.0.0.1</span> is the loopback ip adress for the local computer
                (called localhost).</p>
            <p class="command">What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: <span
                    class="code">22</span>, <span class="code">23</span>, <span class="code">25</span>,
                <span class="code">53</span>, <span class="code">80</span>, <span class="code">443</span>?</p>
            <p class="answer">Since the server uses 53 (dns), 80 (http) and 443 (https) i would assume that the server
                hosts a website.</p>
            <p class="command">What is the IP address of <span class="code">studypoints.dk</span> and how did you find
                it?</p>

            <p class="answer">$ ping studypoints.dk</p>
            <p class="answer code">165.227.137.75</p>
            <p class="command">If you write <span class="code">https://studypoints.dk</span> in your browser, how did
                “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?</p>
            <p class="answer"> The browser performs a DNS lookup to get the ip address of the website.</p>
            <p class="command">Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both</p>
            <p class="answer">The purpose of an ip-address is to identify devices on a network. Ports are the endpoints
                of communication. It's not enough to deliver data to the correct device. An application or protocol on
                the device listens to incoming data on ports.</p>
            <p class="command">What is your (nearest) DNS server,?</p>
            <p class="answer">Yes</p>
            <p class="command">What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?</p>
            <p class="answer">The DNS system maps domains to ip addresses. The point of a DNS server is to allow DNS
                lookups.</p>
            <p class="command">What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?</p>
            <p class="answer code">$ ipconfig</p>
            <p class="answer code">Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 10.50.128.1</p>
            <p class="command">What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?</p>
            <p class="answer code">$ ipconfig /all</p>
            <p class="answer code">$ DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.255.1.10</p>
            <p class="command">Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack</p>
            <p class="answer">The TCP/IP-protocol is divided into layers.</p>
            <p class="answer">The application layer is the top layer of TCP/IP protocol suite. This layer includes
                applications or processes that use transport layer protocols to deliver the data to destination
                computers.</p>
            <p class="answer">The transport layer receives data from theapplication layer above it and transports it to
                some destination.</p>
            <p class="answer">
                The network layer, also known as Internet layer. The main purpose of this layer is to organize or handle
                the movement of data on a network.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">The link layer. This layer is also known as network interface layer. This layer normally
                consists of device drivers in the OS and the network interface card attached to the system. </p>
            <p class="command">Explain about the HTTP Protocol</p>
            <p class="answer">The HTTP protocol defines data communication for the world wide web.</p>
            <p class="command">Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where
                does it fit into
                TCP/IP)</p>
            <p class="answer">The HTTP protocol resides in the Application Layer of the TCP/IP-protocol. HTTP uses
                TCP-IP.</p>
